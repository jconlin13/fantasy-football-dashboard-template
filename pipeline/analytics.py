"""Records, head-to-head and luck -- everything computed from the `games` table.

These three live together because they are the same data grouped three ways:
by extreme (records), by pairing (head-to-head), and by week (luck). Phase 5's
lineup and draft analytics read different tables and live elsewhere.

Every number here has to be explainable in one sentence, because the whole
point of this site is settling arguments. A stat nobody can explain just starts
a new argument about the stat.

Only counting games are used: no byes and no consolation games, per the league's
rule. The third-place game does count -- it is contested by the two teams still
alive going into the last round, unlike the fifth- and seventh-place games. See
model.COUNTING_BRACKETS.
