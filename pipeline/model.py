"""The league as plain Python, loaded from the raw archive.

Every analytic reads this module and nothing reads ESPN's JSON directly. The
point is that ESPN's quirks get dealt with exactly once, here, instead of
leaking into eight different metrics that each handle them slightly differently.

No network. Everything comes from data/raw, which is committed.

The central table is `games`: one row per team per week, so a single matchup
produces two rows facing each other. Records, head-to-head and luck are all
just different groupings of that one table.
