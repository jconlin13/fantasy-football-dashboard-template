"""Print the SHA-256 of a passphrase, for config/draft.ini.

Run this yourself and paste the hash. The passphrase is typed into a hidden
prompt, is never written to disk, and never appears in your shell history.

    python3 pipeline/hash_passphrase.py

Worth knowing what this does and does not do. The site is static, so the check
happens in the visitor's browser: the hash is public and someone determined
could guess the word offline. It is a speed bump that keeps the League Home
button out of the way of people who are not in the league -- ESPN's own login is
what actually stops a stranger from getting anywhere useful once they click it.
