"""Who had who -- the roster each manager closed a season with.

Built for one reason: this is a keeper league, and the group chat asks "wait
who even had him" every August. The archive already has the answer in
mRoster's end-of-season snapshot; this just resolves it to manager names and
labels how each player got there.

Position ids are read from the data, not hardcoded from memory -- {1,2,3,4,5,16}
appear in every season 2018-2025, and 7 (punter) only from 2025 on, matching the
year this league's roster added a punter slot. An id outside the known map is
reported rather than silently mislabeled.

`points` is the player's whole real-world season total -- the same number
on any ESPN player card -- not "points scored while this manager owned
them." A player added midseason still shows their full-season number. That is
a deliberate, simpler definition; a fantasy-team-scoped total is a different
stat (see draft.py's `returned`, which is exactly that) and mixing the two on
one page would need two different labels to stay honest.

How a player got onto the roster:

    Drafted      picked in this team's own draft. Shown with round.pick-in-round
                 (e.g. "1.4" is round 1, pick 4 of that round) -- never the
                 overall pick number, which mixes rounds together and is a
                 worse answer to "where did I get him."
    Free Agent   not in this team's draft picks -- added off waivers, free
                 agency, or by trade. The archive cannot tell those three
                 apart (see draft.py's trade-market findings: real trade
                 participants are recoverable for 2 of 8 seasons' trades), so
                 they are not claimed to be told apart here either.
    Added        drafted AND flagged by ESPN's own `keeper` bit. Worth calling
                 out only because this league's `keeperCount` setting is 0 and
                 that bit has never once been true across 2018-2026 -- so in
                 practice this status never appears. Kept in the code rather
                 than deleted, in case a future season actually uses it.

Deliberately NOT attempted: keeper cost. ESPN's `keeper` flag says a player
WAS kept, not what a team would owe to keep them again -- that is a
league-specific house rule this code has no way to know, so guessing at one
would be exactly the kind of confident wrong answer worth avoiding.

A season is only shown once its draft has actually happened, checked directly
against mDraftDetail's own `drafted` flag rather than a hardcoded year cutoff.
Before that, ESPN just carries the prior year's rosters forward untouched --
not a keeper list, just stale data with nothing decided yet. This is also
self-updating on purpose: the day the 2026 draft finishes and the archive is
next refreshed, `drafted` flips to true and 2026 appears on this page with no
code change and no one having to remember to update a cutoff.

For the single newest drafted season, two more fields ride along per player
when they're available: next season's ESPN-projected points, and a projected
draft round derived from ESPN's average-draft-position (an industry-wide
number, not specific to this league's eventual draft, rounded up to whichever
round it would land in for a league this size). Both come from whichever of
the ten teams currently rosters that player next season -- there is no
archived view of the wider free-agent pool, so a player not on any of next
season's ten rosters (retired, cut everywhere) simply has neither field,
rather than a guessed one.

    Built from year+1's own rostered players -- there is no archived view of
    the full free-agent pool, only what the ten teams currently hold, so
    coverage is real but not complete (94% of a full roster carries over,
    checked against 2025 -> 2026). A player found on more than one team's
    roster across the season (traded) keeps the first entry seen; ESPN's
    projection is a property of the player, not the team, so it does not
    matter which one.

    ESPN's averageDraftPosition is a single continuous number across the
    whole overall draft (e.g. 11.85), not round-and-pick -- so round.pick is
    computed the same way an overall pick number becomes one for a real
    draft, round = ceil(overall / team_count), and never just the raw ADP
    printed with a decimal point. That distinction is not cosmetic: an ADP of
    1.33 formatted carelessly reads exactly like round-1-pick-33, which does
    not exist in a 10-team league. Properly split, 1.33 is round 1, and 1.33
    positions into round 1 (no subtraction needed since it is under the team
    count), rounded to the nearest whole pick -> pick 1. A raw ADP of 11.85
    becomes round ceil(11.85/10)=2, position 11.85-10=1.85 into that round,
    nearest pick 2 -> "2.2". The pick half is clamped to [1, team_count] so
    float edge cases at a round boundary can never spill into a pick number
    that does not exist in this league.
