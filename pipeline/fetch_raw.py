"""Archive every view ESPN will serve, for every season, to data/raw.

This is the only script that talks to ESPN for real data. Everything downstream
reads the archive, never the network, so the site can be rebuilt years from now
when ESPN has forgotten the league ever existed.

Two shapes of request, because ESPN has two:

    season views   one call per year        -> data/raw/{year}/{view}.json.gz
    weekly views   one call per week        -> data/raw/{year}/weeks/{nn}/{view}.json.gz

The weekly split is not a preference. mBoxscore returns no lineups and
mTransactions2 returns zero transactions unless the request names a single
scoringPeriodId -- asking for the season as a whole silently returns less data
rather than failing, which is exactly the kind of thing that goes unnoticed for
a year. Verified against the live league on 2026-08-05.

Payloads are pseudonymized before they are written: no SWID and no real name
ever reaches data/raw. See identity.py.
