"""Strip personal data out of ESPN payloads before anything reaches a public repo.

ESPN identifies managers by SWID -- a GUID tied to their ESPN account -- and
ships their real first and last names alongside it. Neither belongs in a public
repo, but we still need stable identity linkage so a manager's 2018 season and
their 2025 season are recognizably the same person.

So: every SWID is replaced by a deterministic short id derived from it, and the
name fields are lifted out into a gitignored local file. The only names that
ever reach git are the ones written by hand into config/owners.ini.

    {A1B2C3D4-...}  ->  mgr_7f3a91c04e2b

The hash is unsalted on purpose. SWIDs are 128-bit random values, so the digest
cannot be reversed and cannot be brute-forced by enumeration; adding a salt would
buy nothing and would silently corrupt every id if the salt ever differed between
a laptop and CI.
