"""Find out what ESPN will actually give us before building anything on top of it.

Walks backwards from the current season asking for each view, and prints a
grid of what came back. Data availability degrades unpredictably as you go
back -- older seasons routinely drop draft detail, transactions and boxscores
-- so this is the ground truth the rest of the pipeline is written against.
